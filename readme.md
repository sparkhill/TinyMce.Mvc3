# TinyMCE MVC3 with MediaPicker Plugin

Do you like TinyMCE?  Are you tired of trying to find a way to upload and insert media using a rich
text editor?  Do you think the MCImageManager looks absolutely horrible?  Do you also not want to pay
for the horrible looking MCImageManager? 

This project will solve all of your problems.

The MVC mediapicker plugin will derive from the UX provided by the Orchard CMS mediapicker, however
it will maintain the standard appearance of other TinyMCE plugins.  This mediapicker will also boast
impressive performance as all server-client communication will be done via ajax/json.
